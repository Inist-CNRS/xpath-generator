                    <meta-value>3 Computers and the Social Sciences: An Introduction SAGE Publications, Inc.1985DOI: 10.1177/089443938500100101 Ronald E. Anderson Computers and the Social Sciences 1 (1985) @Para&lt;Mgm Press, Inc. It is a pleasure and honor to introduce
                        the inaugural issue of a journal designed to be the primary source of scholarship for the intersection between the social sciences and computers. While concentrating on social and behavioral science research into the impact of computers, Computers
                        and the Social Sciences (CaSS) also will include articles which critically analyze and offer perspectives on the emerging role of computers in the methods of the social and behavioral sciences. Each issue will contain scholarly articles advancing the
                        theory and knowledge regarding the social role of computers or reporting social science research through applications of computing and related technology. CaSS is addressed to social scientists, computer scientists, policy researchers, planners,
                        teachers, students, and others interested in the changing societal processes or social research methods which result from the increasing use of computer technology. CASTS is intended to be a reliable source of information for those who need to know
                        how computers affect social life, how the impact of specific computing applications or computer-related policies can be evaluated, or how computers can be effectively used in social science research. As computers are introduced into the home,
                        workplace, and school, they become part of the relationship between client and service organizations, government and citizen, student and educational institution. They affect the fundamental nature of the information we use to understand our world
                        and to make decisions at an individual, organizational and institutional level. Our need to understand the implications of this profound change in our basic societal relationships is becoming increasingly vital. To meet these needs, Computers and the
                        Social Sciences will explore how various segments of socie- ty, such as students, office workers, the elderly, women and persons in mid-career, are affected by computer technology. It will examine the effects of that technology on
                        information-gathering, research methodology and analytical thinking in the social sciences. It will explore how computers are creating change in societal dynamics, such as migration patterns, the emergence of subcultures, the welfare of racial
                        minorities, and the communications and power of other groups, such as religious sects. This ~ first issue of Casts, for instance, features a sum, mary of research findings on gender differences in computer learning, a conceptual paradigm for research
                        on home computing, an analysis of the bureaucratic meaning of keyboarding, and a paper on how relational database concepts can improve theory construction in the social sciences. To achieve its goals, CaSS must be truly multidisciplinary,
                        multimethodological and multinational. Among the Associate Editors and the Advisory Council are specialists from anthropology, computer science, economics, educational research, history, management science, political science, psychology, sociology,
                        and statistics. Our methodological orientations range from the philosophical to the extremely quantitative. As can be seen in the first issue, we have no bias toward either qualitative or quantitative methods. Different types of research questions
                        require different methods. Since the development of scientific knowledge depends upon the maturity of the underlying theory and analytical frameworks, we will publish creative conceptualizations and comprehensive syntheses of research results. As an
                        international journal, Computers and the Social Sciences seeks articles and reviewers from any country. Our goal is to publish important research results no matter where they may be found. During the next few years we hope to find and pub- 4 lish a
                        number of cross-national studies. By the turn of the century we are apt to interpret this decade as a time of major transition brought on by the rapid evolution of computing technologies. In order to control more of our destiny, it will be necessary
                        to understand more about the interface between computer technology and social reality. This journal is dedicated to this challenge, and this is an invitation to participate in this effort as reader, discussant, researcher, or author. The Board of
                        Reviewers The Advisory Council was selected to help formulate well-informed policies to guide CaSS during the next three years; an additional group, called the Board of Reviewers, has been established to provide diverse expertise to evaluate articles
                        subID11:ted and books for review. The Board of Reviewers, which already constitutes over 75 specialists, will be listed in the last issue of CAWS each year. If you have an interest and expertise in any of the topics related to Computers and the
                        Social Sciences, I would like to hear from you and learn about your work. All submissions of papers are reviewed by Associate Editors, the Advisory Council, or members of the Board of Reviewers. CaSS Bulletin Board To facilitate exchange of
                        information pertaining to CaSS, an experimental Bulletin Board System (BBS) has been established. This remote microcomputer system can be accessed from terminals and micros using 300 or 1200 baud modems. It runs continuously except that between 10
                        a.m. and 5 p.m. it will be down for maintenance and other projects. To access the system, dial 612/376-1634 and after establishing a connection press the ENTER key two or three times and answer the questions asked of you. Once into the system, you
                        can read or leave messages, read bulletins pertaining to CaSS, and send short document files to the Editor and other users of the Bulletin Board.</meta-value>
